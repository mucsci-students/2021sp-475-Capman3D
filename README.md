## AI Explanation
The spiders use a waypoint-based pathfinding AI to travel towards their target point. The target point is different for each spider, to reflect their personalities (see the "meet the spiders" section). The spiders also switch between chasing their target and wandering randomly. The lengths of these phases are slightly randomized each time, but the base lengths for the wander and chase phases are equal at the start of a game. As the rounds increase, the base lengths get shorter for the wander phase and longer for the chase phase, until eventually the spiders permanently chase their target.
